# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Function `crate::supported_protocol_versions` that returns a `Vec<ProtocolVersions>` supported by the crate.
- Top level `Pdu` struct is now `Clone`.

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- EntityState serialisation reported incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer.

### Security

## [0.11.0] - 2024-12-12

### Added

- Convenience access methods to the common `state` and `is_frozen` fields on `EntityAppearance` and enum variants (
  by [@MatthewS8](https://github.com/MatthewS8)).
- Support for Serde serialization/deserialization via `serde` feature flag.
- Added example for using serde_json to output PDUs as JSON.

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

## [0.10.0] - 2024-11-26

### Added

- `ClockTime` implements `Copy`.

### Changed

- Updated `SISO-REF-010` to `v33`.
- Enumerations generated by `build.rs` now have proper _UpperCamelCase_ names (for example, `LifeForm` rather than
  `Lifeform`). Thanks to [@carlocorradini](https://github.com/carlocorradini).

## [0.9.0] - 2024-06-26

### Added

- `DisError` now uses `thiserror` crate that transitively implements `std::error::Error`.
- `EntityId` implements `Display`: `site:application:entity`.

### Changed

- `MSRV 1.73`
- Replaced generated code formatting from `rustfmt` to `prettyplease` avoiding the need to have a system-wide
  installation.

### Fixed

- In PDU parsers, subtractions were replaced with `saturating_sub()` to prevent panics.
- Missing fields in `Fire` PDU builder.

## [0.8.0] - 2024-04-03

### Added

- `UnderwaterAcoustics` PDU

### Changed

- Export `BodyInfo` and `Interaction` traits
- Changed the main serialization function for `PDU` to be fallible.
  It now returns `DisError::InsufficientBufferSize` when the provided buffer does not have enough capacity to serialize
  the entire `PDU`.
  This should prevent the library from panicking during serialization.
  `Serialize` trait is not changed, `PDU` now no longer implements this trait but provides the function with the changed
  signature (returning `Result<u16, DisError>`).
  `impl`s for the `Serialize` and `SerializePdu` traits are not changed and could still panic, but are practically only
  to be called via `PDU::serialize()`, thus behind the capacity check in that method

## [0.7.0] - 2024-03-12

### Added

- Logistics PDUs:
    - `ServiceRequest` PDU
    - `ResupplyOffer` PDU
    - `ResupplyReceived` PDU
    - `ResupplyCancel` PDU
    - `RepairComplete` PDU
    - `RepairResponse` PDU
- Simulation management with reliability PDUs
- `SEES` PDU
- EntityManagement PDUs:
    - `IsPartOf` PDU
    - `IsGroupOf` PDU
    - `TransferOwnership` PDU
    - `AggregateState` PDU
- Convenience trait implementations (`FromStr`, `Display`, `TryFrom`, `Hash`) for records `EntityType` and
  `AggregateType`
- Improved references to the specification in code

### Changed

- Updated Enumerations to `SISO-REF-010 v32`

### Fixed

- Minor hygiene fixes

## [0.6.0] - 2024-02-04

### Added

- `IFF` PDU
- Internal consistency tests for all PDUs:
    1. Create a PDU
    2. Write to buffer
    3. Parse back in
    4. Compare

### Changed

- Refactoring all PDUs to have:
    1. More cleaner builders
    2. Internal consistency tests
    3. Improving references to the standard document in the code
- Timestamps are now modeled according to the standard instead of just an `u32` field.
  Use by means of casting a `TimeStamp` (which just wraps a `u32` for compatibility) to a `DisTimeStamp`

### Fixed

- `Signal` PDU processing (data length in bits vs bytes)

## [0.5.2] - 2023-10-04
