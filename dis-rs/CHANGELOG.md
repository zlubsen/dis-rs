## Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.10.0] - 2024-11-26

### Added

- `ClockTime` implements `Copy`

### Changed

- Updated `SISO-REF-010` to `v33`
- Enumerations generated by `build.rs` now have proper _UpperCamelCase_ names (for example, `LifeForm` rather than `Lifeform`). Thanks to [@carlocorradini](https://github.com/carlocorradini)

## [0.9.0] - 2024-06-26

### Added

- `DisError` now uses `thiserror` crate that transitively implements `std::error::Error`
- `EntityId` implements `Display`: `site:application:entity`

### Changed

- `MSRV 1.73`
- Replaced generated code formatting from `rustfmt` to `prettyplease` avoiding the need to have a system-wide installation

### Fixed

- In PDU parsers, subtractions were replaced with `saturating_sub()` to prevent panics
- Missing fields in `Fire` PDU builder

## [0.8.0] - 2024-04-03

### Added

- `UnderwaterAcoustics` PDU

### Changed

- Export `BodyInfo` and `Interaction` traits
- Changed the main serialization function for `PDU` to be fallible.
  It now returns `DisError::InsufficientBufferSize` when the provided buffer does not have enough capacity to serialize the entire `PDU`.
  This should prevent the library from panicking during serialization.
  `Serialize` trait is not changed, `PDU` now no longer implements this trait but provides the function with the changed signature (returning `Result<u16, DisError>`).
  `impl`s for the `Serialize` and `SerializePdu` traits are not changed and could still panic, but are practically only to be called via `PDU::serialize()`, thus behind the capacity check in that method

## [0.7.0] - 2024-03-12

### Added

- Logistics PDUs:
  - `ServiceRequest` PDU
  - `ResupplyOffer` PDU
  - `ResupplyReceived` PDU
  - `ResupplyCancel` PDU
  - `RepairComplete` PDU
  - `RepairResponse` PDU
- Simulation management with reliability PDUs
- `SEES` PDU
- EntityManagement PDUs:
  - `IsPartOf` PDU
  - `IsGroupOf` PDU
  - `TransferOwnership` PDU
  - `AggregateState` PDU
- Convenience trait implementations (`FromStr`, `Display`, `TryFrom`, `Hash`) for records `EntityType` and `AggregateType`
- Improved references to the specification in code

### Changed

- Updated Enumerations to `SISO-REF-010 v32`

### Fixed

- Minor hygiene fixes

## [0.6.0] - 2024-02-04

### Added

- `IFF` PDU
- Internal consistency tests for all PDUs:
  1. Create a PDU
  2. Write to buffer
  3. Parse back in
  4. Compare

### Changed

- Refactoring all PDUs to have:
  1. More cleaner builders
  2. Internal consistency tests
  3. Improving references to the standard document in the code
- Timestamps are now modeled according to the standard instead of just an `u32` field.
  Use by means of casting a `TimeStamp` (which just wraps a `u32` for compatibility) to a `DisTimeStamp`

### Fixed

- `Signal` PDU processing (data length in bits vs bytes)

## [0.5.2] - 2023-10-04

### Fixed

- Issue [#1](https://github.com/zlubsen/dis-rs/issues/1)
