# DIS for Rust

`dis-rs` is a suite of libraries and applications centered around the Distributed Interactive Simulation protocol (IEEE 1278.1), implemented in the Rust programming language and for use in Rust-based simulation applications.

This repository hosts a number of sub-projects, each located in a specific directory:

- [dis-rs](./dis-rs)\
   Foundational implementation of DIS, offering models, parsing, serialization and enumerations for DIS PDUs.
- [cdis-assemble](./cdis-assemble)\
  Foundational implementation of C-DIS (SISO-STD-023-2024), offering models, parsing, serialization and conversion (to and from DIS) for C-DIS PDUs.
- [cdis-gateway](./cdis-gateway)\
  CLI application for encoding/decoding DIS to/from C-DIS.

See `README.md` of each project for more details.

## Goal and vision

The goal of `dis-rs` is to provide the libraries and tools to use the DIS protocol in Rust-based applications
Currently, the basic implementation of the most relevant DIS PDUs is present, making the library usable for simulation applications
Additionally, a gateway implementing C-DIS is available

We intend to develop this project into a suite of tools that make it easy to integrate DIS into applications, having:

- A library that provides features beyond basic construction and usage of PDUs (reading/writing from a network using UDP sockets, heartbeats and dead reckoning logic, etc.)
- Application(s) to monitor and manage DIS network traffic (statistics, network load, filtering, routing)
- Application(s) to monitor DIS simulation data/state (map, view, interactions)

## Supported versions and maturity

`dis-rs` focuses on versions 6 and 7 of the DIS protocol. Version 7 is considered leading, meaning that v6 PDUs are mapped to v7 models transparently to the user (irregardless of the wire-format version).
